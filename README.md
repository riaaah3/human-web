## Description

Welcome to the Human Web.
This back end application is a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list, as shown by the video below.
Users can create their own profiles, with their own thoughts, add friends to their own profiles, and also see other users' thoughts.
This application also gives the ability to remove user profiles, removing that user and all their thoughts.

One key thing users should be able take away from this application is the ability to communicate amongst each other,
which is the baseline for a good social networking website all together.
